# LunaOS Beta User Outreach Templates

## 1. Cold Email Template

**Subject:** Build AI agents in minutes, not months — free beta access

Hi [NAME],

I came across [PROJECT] and loved how you approached [SPECIFIC_FEATURE]. I'm building LunaOS, an open platform for deploying AI agents to the edge with built-in RAG, MCP tools, and chain workflows.

I think [PROJECT] could benefit from our agent orchestration layer — no infra management, just ship.

We're inviting 50 developers into our free beta:
- 100 agent runs/month on the free tier
- Cloudflare edge deployment (sub-50ms globally)
- Visual Studio IDE for building agent workflows

Would you try it out and give honest feedback? Sign up at [lunaos.ai/beta](https://lunaos.ai/beta).

Best,
Shahar
